Positive Actions for a Better World


- - -


Positive action can begin at home, right now.  You only have to make the decision to act.  But where do you start?  How do we become a force for good in a complicated world?

A Greater Mass aims to simplify this problem.

A Greater Mass is your guidebook of individual actions to tackle the interlinked issues of climate change and human rights, all whilst maintaining your own mental health in avoiding compassion fatigue and eco anxiety.  The actions range from giving up plastic bottles, to sending a letter to a Prisoner of Conscience.  Positive actions for a better world.

These simple challenges that are easily completed by each individual, but collectively aggregate into a huge mass effect.  **Small actions individually have a big impact collectively**.  A Greater Mass is a year-long handbook that will inflame huge social and environmental change.

It's simple really; you tick off the actions on the app as you complete them, and we show you all the people also taking those steps.  That way you can see, feel and be a part of the change you are creating.

And as our mass grows, so too will our gravity; pulling more and more individuals to the cause.

Mass and gravity are delicately interlinked.

Out in Space, minuscule particles of dust exert gravity on smaller molecules in the vicinity.  As these particles join together, their collective power grows, attracting more matter from further afield.  Soon huge volumes of elements aggregate together, and their collective energy has the power to incite nuclear fusion; the same force majeure that creates the life-giving energy of our own Sun.

How does gravity obtain this level of power?  By having a greater mass.

If dust out in the aether has the collaborative force to give birth to stars, imagine the soaring limits of our own human capacity.  Our unified power is unending.

Join the collective, become part of A Greater Mass.
